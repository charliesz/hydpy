"""The HydPy-L-Land model (`lland`) allows for the subdivision of subbasins
into hydrological response units (hru).  Some processes, e.g. interception,
are calculated seperately for each zone.  This is why some parameters (e.g.
the usable field capacity :class:`~hydpy.models.lland.lland_control.NFk`)
and some sequences (e.g. the actual soil water storage
:class:`~hydpy.models.lland.lland_states.BoWa`) are 1-dimensional.  Each entry
represents the value of a different hru.

In contrasts to the original LARSIM model, the HydPy-L-Land model allows for
arbitrary definitions of units.  Nevertheless, the original distinction
in accordance with sixteen different landuse types is still supported.  The
parameter :class:`~hydpy.models.lland.lland_control.Lnk` defines,
which entry of e.g. :class:`~hydpy.models.lland.lland_control.NFk` is
related to which land use type via integer values.  Note that for the units
of the most land use types, the same equations are applied. Only units
of type `VERS` and `WASSER` are partly connected to different process
equations.

For comprehensibility, this module introduces the relevant integer constants.
